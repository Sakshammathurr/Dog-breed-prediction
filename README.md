The problem statement for this project would be to build a CNN model that can classify dog images into different breeds. To accomplish this, we would need a dataset of dog images with corresponding labels indicating their breed which we took from kaggle using API.

Next, we would need to preprocess the data by resizing the images to a fixed size, normalizing the pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. We can also use data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or zooming the images to increase the size of our dataset and prevent overfitting.

We can train the CNN model using a loss function like categorical cross-entropy and an optimizer like stochastic gradient descent or Adam. We can also use techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance.

Finally, we can evaluate the performance of our CNN model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. We can also visualize the model's predictions using tools like confusion matrices or Grad-CAM to understand which areas of the image the model is focusing on for its predictions.

A deep learning project using a CNN model for dog breed prediction would involve data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization. With careful tuning of the model architecture and hyperparameters, we can build an accurate and robust classifier for identifying dog breeds from images.
